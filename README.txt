== Notes ==

To ensure the functioning of the Plugin we use a third party service which detects if the advertisements are displayed correctly on your website, otherwise our system will automatically generate new identifiers for you or may update our plugin if necessary.

The data we use is the name of your website, the positions of the advertisements and the number of ads displayed, they are automatically sent to [AdsMatcher](https://www.adsmatcher.com/privacy-policy/).
